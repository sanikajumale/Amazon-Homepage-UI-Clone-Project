# Amazon-Homepage-UI-Clone-Project
 I designed a static Amazon homepage user interface using HTML and CSS. This project  helped me understand how real e-commerce websites are structured, including the navigation bar, product sections, and footer  layout. I mainly focused on clean UI design, proper alignment using Flexbox, and improving my frontend styling skills.
